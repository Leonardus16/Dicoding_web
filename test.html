                            Even though solid wood is stronger than particle board, in term of cost, particle board is the better choice and more valuable 
                            because it made of wood waste thus it is greener for the environment. 
                            Nowadays with the continuous development of our production technology, RPI Particle Board quality is better than before. 
                            It can resist more temperature and humidity change, stronger against tensile and pressure stress.
                            RPI Particle Board is also well known for its high quality flat surface and size accuracy. We have been certified by JIS (Japan Industrial Standard) since 2007. JIS Certification requires a high-level quality management system through qualification audit process and also product testing. 
                            This proves that RPI is a high quality particle board manufacturer.

                            MFC is created by laminating a decorative paper or textile onto the surface of chipboard or particleboard using melamine resin. 
                            The decorative layer is impregnated with melamine resin, which is then bonded to the wood substrate through heat and pressure. 
                            This process creates a finished panel that has the visual appeal of various colors, patterns, and textures while retaining the structural stability of the underlying chipboard.
                            Commonly used for : furniture manufacturing, interior design, and construction.
